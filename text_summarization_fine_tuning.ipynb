        "In this notebook, we will fine-tune the Facebook/BART-large-cnn model on the BillSum dataset. In the previous notebook, we explored and evaluated various text summarization models, including BART, and now we will take the next step by adapting the BART model specifically for summarizing legislative text data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fine-tuning a pre-trained model can be a challenging process, as it requires a good understanding of the dataset, model architecture, and the underlying task. The process often involves hyperparameter optimization to find the best combination of settings that yield optimal performance. However, in this notebook, we will stick to the recommended model settings to simplify the fine-tuning process.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, you will:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Gain an understanding of the fine-tuning process, its challenges, and the importance of hyperparameter optimization.\n",
        "2. Learn how to prepare the BillSum dataset for the fine-tuning process, including data preprocessing and splitting.\n",
        "3. Explore the recommended settings for the Facebook/BART-large-cnn model and understand their significance in the fine-tuning process.\n",
        "4. Implement the fine-tuning process using the recommended settings and observe how the model adapts to the legislative text data.\n",
        "5. Evaluate the fine-tuned model on multiple samples from the BillSum dataset, considering ROUGE as a comparison.\n",
        "6. Discuss the implications of fine-tuning with the recommended settings and the potential benefits of hyperparameter optimization for achieving better performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this notebook, you will have a deeper understanding of the fine-tuning process, the challenges involved, and the importance of hyperparameter optimization. You will also gain practical experience in fine-tuning the Facebook/BART-large-cnn model on the BillSum dataset and evaluating its performance on legislative text data. Let's dive into the fascinating world of fine-tuning and enhance the capabilities of our text summarization model!"

We set skip_special_tokens=True to remove any special tokens (e.g., padding or EOS tokens) from the decoded text.\n",

        "3. `references = tokenizer.batch_decode(eval_prediction.label_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)`: Similarly, we decode the reference summaries (ground truth) stored in `eval_prediction.label_ids` using the tokenizer's `batch_decode()` function, while also removing any special tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. `return rouge.compute(predictions=predictions, references=references)`: We compute the ROUGE score using the `rouge.compute()` function with the decoded predictions and reference summaries as input. The function returns the calculated ROUGE scores, which serve as the evaluation metric for the model's performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "We need this function for the Trainer class provided by the Hugging Face transformers library. The Trainer class requires a custom function to compute metrics during the evaluation phase. By defining compute_rouge, we can integrate the ROUGE metric into the training and evaluation workflow, allowing us to assess the model's performance in generating summaries."
