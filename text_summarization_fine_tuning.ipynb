        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we will fine-tune the Facebook/BART-large-cnn model on the BillSum dataset. In the previous notebook, we explored and evaluated various text summarization models, including BART, and now we will take the next step by adapting the BART model specifically for summarizing legislative text data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fine-tuning a pre-trained model can be a challenging process, as it requires a good understanding of the dataset, model architecture, and the underlying task. The process often involves hyperparameter optimization to find the best combination of settings that yield optimal performance. However, in this notebook, we will stick to the recommended model settings to simplify the fine-tuning process.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, you will:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Gain an understanding of the fine-tuning process, its challenges, and the importance of hyperparameter optimization.\n",
        "2. Learn how to prepare the BillSum dataset for the fine-tuning process, including data preprocessing and splitting.\n",
        "3. Explore the recommended settings for the Facebook/BART-large-cnn model and understand their significance in the fine-tuning process.\n",
        "4. Implement the fine-tuning process using the recommended settings and observe how the model adapts to the legislative text data.\n",
        "5. Evaluate the fine-tuned model on multiple samples from the BillSum dataset, considering ROUGE as a comparison.\n",
        "6. Discuss the implications of fine-tuning with the recommended settings and the potential benefits of hyperparameter optimization for achieving better performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this notebook, you will have a deeper understanding of the fine-tuning process, the challenges involved, and the importance of hyperparameter optimization. You will also gain practical experience in fine-tuning the Facebook/BART-large-cnn model on the BillSum dataset and evaluating its performance on legislative text data. Let's dive into the fascinating world of fine-tuning and enhance the capabilities of our text summarization model!"

        "This following code evaluates the fine-tuned model on 10 samples from the test dataset and computes the ROUGE scores for the generated summaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "- `generated_summaries`: A list comprehension is used to call the generate_summary function for each of the first 10 samples in the ca_test dataset. This generates a list of summaries produced by the model for each input text.\n",
        "\n",
        "- `reference_summaries`: A list comprehension is used to extract the first 10 reference summaries from the ca_test dataset. These reference summaries serve as the ground truth for comparison with the generated summaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "- `rouge = evaluate.load('rouge')`: The ROUGE evaluation metric is loaded using the evaluate library.\n",
        "\n",
        "- `rouge_scores`: The rouge.compute() method is called with the predictions (generated_summaries) and references (reference_summaries) as its arguments. This computes the ROUGE scores (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, and ROUGELsum) for the generated summaries compared to the reference summaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "We evaluate the model on different variants of ROUGE, which consider different aspects of the summaries, such as n-grams and the longest common subsequence. ROUGE was introduced in the paper titled \"[ROUGE: A Package for Automatic Evaluation of Summaries](https://aclanthology.org/W04-1013.pdf)\" by Chin-Yew Lin in 2004\n",
